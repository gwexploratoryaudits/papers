  abstract =    {
                    We propose a simple risk-limiting audit for elections, ClipAudit.
                    To determine whether candidate A (the reported winner) actually
                    beat candidate B in a plurality
                    election,
                    ClipAudit draws ballots at random, without replacement, until
                    either all cast ballots have been drawn, or until
                    \[
                          a - b \ge \beta \sqrt{a+b}
                    \]
                    where $a$ is the number of ballots in the sample for the reported winner A, and
                    $b$ is the number of ballots in the sample for opponent B, and
                    where $\beta$ is a constant determined a priori as a function
                    of the number $n$ of ballots cast and the risk-limit $\alpha$.
                    \par
                    ClipAudit doesn't depend on the unofficial margin (as does Bravo).
                    \par
                    We show how to extend ClipAudit to contests with multiple winners
                    or losers, or to multiple contests.
