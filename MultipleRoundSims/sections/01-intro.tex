%Intro
The literature contains numerous descriptions of vulnerabilities in deployed voting systems, and it is not possible to be certain that any system, however well-designed, will perform as expected in all instances. For this reason, 
{\em evidence-based elections} aim to produce trustworthy and compelling evidence of the correctness of election outcomes, enabling the detection of problems with high probability. One way to implement an evidence-based election is to use a well-curated voter-verified paper trail, compliance audits, and a rigorous tabulation audit of the election outcome, known as a risk-limiting audit (RLA). This paper provides insight into the main approach to ballot polling RLAs, the \BRAVO audit \cite{bravo}, and the newer \Minerva \cite{usenix_minerva} ballot polling RLA, through the presentation of simulation results. While some properties of the two audits may be theoretically derived, for other properties theoretical results are not available. This paper examines the number of ballots drawn over multiple rounds of both audits, and also examines the related probabilities of stopping if the election is as announced, and the maximum risk of the audit. 

\subsection{Background}
This paper focuses on ballot-polling RLAs, which require a large number of ballots but do not rely on any special features of the election technology. In the general ballot-polling risk limiting audit (RLA), a number of ballots are drawn and tallied in what is termed a {\em round} of ballots \cite{usenix_minerva}. A statistical measure is then computed to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to declare the election outcome correct within the pre-determined risk limit. Because the decision is made after drawing a round of ballots, the audit is termed a {\em round-by-round (R2)} audit. The special case when round size is one---that is, stopping decisions are made after each ballot draw---is a {\em ballot-by-ballot (B2)} audit. 

The \BRAVO audit is designed for use as a B2 audit: it requires the smallest expected number of ballots when the true tally of the underlying election is as announced, and stopping decisions are made after each ballot draw. In practice, election officials draw many ballots at once, and the \BRAVO stopping rule needs to be modified for use in an R2 audit that is not B2. There are two obvious approaches. The B2 stopping condition can be applied once at the end of each round: End-of Round (EoR) \BRAVO.  Alternatively, the order of ballots in the sample can be tracked by election officials and the B2 \BRAVO stopping condition can be applied retroactively after each ballot drawn: Selection-Ordered (SO) \BRAVO. SO \BRAVO requires fewer ballots on average than EoR \BRAVO but requires the work of tracking the order of ballots rather than just their tally.

\Minerva was designed for R2 audits and applies its stopping rule once for each round. Thus it does not require the tracking of ballots that SO \BRAVO does. It has been proven that \Minerva is a risk-limiting audit and requires fewer ballots to be sampled than EoR \BRAVO when an audit is performed in rounds. Simulations have also been presented to understand better its first round properties; these show that \Minerva also draws fewer ballots than SO \BRAVO for large first rounds. There are no results, however, either theoretical or based on simulations, regarding the expected number of ballots drawn over multiple rounds in a \Minerva audit. Further, there is no literature comparing the number of ballots drawn by \Minerva and EoR or SO \BRAVO over multiple rounds. 

Both \BRAVO and \Minerva have been integrated into election audit software {\em Arlo} \cite{arlo}, and, as such, available for use in real election audits. Both have been used in real election audits. For this reason, it is very important to understand their properties over multiple rounds.
