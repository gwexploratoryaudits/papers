\begin{abstract}
    In this paper we present simulation results comparing the risk, stopping probability and number of ballots required over multiple rounds of ballot polling risk limiting audits (RLAs) \Minerva, Selection-Ordered (SO) \BRAVO and End-of-Round (EoR) \BRAVO.    
    
    \BRAVO is the most commonly used ballot polling RLA and requires the smallest expected number of ballots when ballots are drawn one at a time and the (true) underlying election is as announced. In real audits, election officials draw multiple ballots at a time, and \BRAVO rules may be implemented as SO \BRAVO or EoR \BRAVO, with neither being optimal for large first round sizes. \Minerva was recently proposed for use when the first-round stopping probability is large. It requires fewer first-round ballots, on average, than both SO \BRAVO and EoR \BRAVO for first round stopping probabilities of $0.9$ when the (true) underlying election is as announced. 
    
    An open question, however, is how \Minerva compares to SO \BRAVO and EoR \BRAVO over multiple rounds, and for lower stopping probabilities.  In this paper, we present results from simulations of multiple round audits. We examine both: first-round stopping probabilities of $0.9$, a common choice among election officials, and $0.25$, which would be more favorable to \BRAVO. 
        
We show that the simulation results are consistent with predictions of the R2B2 open-source library for ballot polling audits. Because the \Minerva round schedule needs to be predetermined, we observe that the simulator is useful as a tool for understanding the behavior of \Minerva with the fixed round schedule. Most importantly, we observe that both \BRAVO audits are more conservative than needed, while \Minerva audits stop with fewer ballots, for both first round stopping probabilities. However, the advantage of using \Minerva decreases considerably for the smaller first round stopping probability, as one would expect.
