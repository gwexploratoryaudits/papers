% pilot
A pilot audit was performed in Providence, Rhode Island in February 2022 from November 2021 special elections.
The audited contest was a question on School Construction and Renovation Projects which had an announced $25.67\%$ margin.
The risk-limit was $10\%$.
A large first round size of $140$ with probability of stopping $95\%$ was selected in order to give many ballots for more interesting analysis afterwards.
