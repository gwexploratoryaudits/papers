% pilot
A pilot audit was performed in Providence, Rhode Island in February 2022 of November 2021 special elections.
The audited contest was a yes-or-no question on School Construction and Renovation Projects and had an announced $25.67\%$ margin.
The risk-limit was $10\%$.
A first round size of $140$ ballots with large probability of stopping ($95\%$) was selected, and selection order was tracked, in order to give the potential for more interesting analysis afterwards. 
As expected, the audit concluded in the first round with a \Providence risk of $4.18\%$. Table~\ref{tab:pilot-risks} shows risk measures for the drawn sample using \Minerva and \BRAVO (both EoR and SO).

TODO: Add examples of how the audits perform for various hypothetical round schedules. I wait to do this until I'm done with the workload estimates since the examples here should be chosen to motivate that section.
