Computations of first-round size for a 0.9 stopping probability when the election is as announced have been computed for a wide range of margins and shown to be smaller than those for both EoR and SO \BRAVO. First round simulations of \Minerva \cite{arxiv_athena} demonstrate that its first-round properties---regarding the probabilities of stopping when the underlying election is tied and when it is as announced---are as predicted for first round sizes with stopping probability 0.9.
