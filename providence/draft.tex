\begin{abstract}
A Risk-Limiting Audit (RLA) draws paper election ballots in subsequent samples called rounds. 
After each round, a rigorous error criterion decides whether to stop (confirming the announced outcome) or continue (draw another round).
The most commonly used RLA, \BRAVO (Stark), requires the fewest ballots when round sizes are 1. 
Recent RLA \Minerva requires fewer ballots than \BRAVO but requires round sizes to be fixed before the audit begins.
We present \Providence, and audit that has similar efficiency to \Minerva and supports choosing round sizes during the audit.
We prove \Providence is Risk-Limiting and resistant to an adversary who can choose subsequent round sizes given previous samples.
We present simulations in which \Providence has similar efficiency to \Minerva.
Finally, we describe the pilot use of \Providence by the Rhode Island Board of Elections.
Our implementation of \Providence in the R2B2 software library provides standard functionality 
plus a function which gives the probability with which an announced loser will appear to be winning
after a round, a potentially useful metric to election officials when choosing round sizes.
% and integrated into Arlo, election audit software used across the US.
