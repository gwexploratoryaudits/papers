% pilot
The Rhode Island Board of Elections performed a pilot audit in Providence 
in February 2022. The contest audited was a single yes-or-no question 
%on School Construction and Renovation Projects
from the November 2021 special election. 
The question had announced margin $25.67\%$.
The audit used risk-limit $10\%$.
A first round size of $140$ ballots with large probability of stopping ($95\%$) was selected
in order to give the potential for more interesting analysis afterwards; the large margin 
made a first round with large stopping probability practical.
Selection order was tracked for the sake of analysis.
As expected, the audit concluded in the first round with a \Providence risk of $4.18\%$. Table~\ref{tab:pilot-risks} shows risk measures for the drawn sample using \Minerva and \BRAVO (both EoR and SO).

TODO: Add examples of how the audits perform for various hypothetical round schedules. I wait to do this until I'm done with the workload estimates since the examples here should be chosen to motivate that section.
